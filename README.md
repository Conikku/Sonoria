Compared to other engines such as Unity and Unreal, vfx creation in roblox is pretty limited, having only beams and an image based particle emitter. Everything else to do with VFX must be manually scripted.
<br><br>
The aim of this project is to improve vfx creation in roblox by making a much more powerful particle API and to largely reduce the needs of scripting by including a simple node based UI.
<br><br>

### Disclaimer:

Currently this is just a PROTOTYPE and an attempt to recreate the default particle emitter. This means that it's not yet meant to be actually used as a replacement to default particle emitters and that it lacks all of the features that would make it a better version of the default particle emitter.
<br> <br>
It may also be buggy and due to reasons the text inputs are scuffed.
