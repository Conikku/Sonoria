# LunarVFX

Roblox particle emitters are very limited and everything else to do with VFX must be scripted. The aim of this project is to make particles much more powerful and to largely reduce the needs of scripting.

### Disclaimer:

---

Currently this is just a PROTOTYPE and an attempt to recreate the default particle emitter. This means that it's not yet meant to be actually used as a replacement to default particle emitters and that it lacks all of the features that would make it a better version of the default particle emitter.
<br> <br>
It also has quite a few problems, such as it having many bugs, quickly becoming laggy and UI being scuffed at parts.
